## Cake Classifier

This directory contains a jupyter notebook for training a cake/not_cake classifier using the fastai library.

The purpose of this classifier to clean the dataset we collect. It would beb very time consuming to manually verify a large dataset. But it doesn't take very many examples to train a decent classifier. So the models that this notebook produces should aid the dataset verification process greatly.
